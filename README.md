# Progress

Each day I use a different programming language.

## Day 1 - Squirrel

A simple language which does not seem to be developed for a while.
The language has documentation which is sufficient, however it lacks more examples.

The task itself was fairly simple, yet it allowed to look for a better than naive algorithm.
