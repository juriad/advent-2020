# Progress

Each day I use a different programming language.

## Day 1 - Squirrel

A simple language which does not seem to be developed for a while.
The language has documentation which is sufficient, however it lacks more examples.

The task itself was fairly simple, yet it allowed to look for a better than naive algorithm.

## Day 2 - Sed

It is well-known that sed is a very powerful tool, yet is it up to this task.
It certainly is and thanks to single-letter command names, the solution is even very short.

The task was mostly about organizing the input so that we could work with two consecutive characters.
Working with unary system was crucial and conversion between unary and decimal numbers was tedious.
